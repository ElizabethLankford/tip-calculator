## Overview

The Tip Calculator app was a challange from Frontend Mentors list of challanges. Given a basic html file with the text content and JPG files to mimic the design and layout. The Tip Calculator requires a bill number input, tip percentage, and the number of people that are splitting the bill. With those values, JavaScript calculates what each person will pay for the tip portion as well as the total that each person will pay.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

- Write the semantic HTML for the page.
- Implement the layout using the mobile-first approach.
- Style using CSS classes and IDs.
- Pull the elements that are needed into JavaScript.
- Create the functionality of the application.
- Test for bugs.
- Implement media queries for larger screen sizes.
- Optimize style and functionality.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I learned that CSS Grid has its benefits over Flexbox. This made me experiment with CSS Grid for the Tip Selection options compared to my normal approach of utilizing only Flexbox for the layout.

### Continued development

One aspect that I want to continue practicing is taking the mobile-first approach to my projects. I found this to be useful and less invasive CSS media queries.
